Future Friendly Images makes your images future-friendly. It inserts a [ffimage] shortcode instead of the hardcoded <img> tag.

== Description ==

**Future Friendly Images* makes your images future-friendly. Out of the box Wordpress hardcodes the <img> tag and all of your chosen settings into your content when you insert an image. Future Friendly Images alleviates this problem by inserting the **[ffimage]** shortcode instead. You can then update your images across your entire site by adjusting the settings on the plugin page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `future-friendly-images` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Start inserting your **Future Friendly Images** into your posts, pages and custom post types.
