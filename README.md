Future Friendly Images
======================

**Future Friendly Images** makes your images future-friendly. Out of the
box Wordpress hardcodes an image tag with all of your chosen settings into
your content when you insert an image. Future Friendly Images alleviates
this problem by inserting the **[ffimage]** shortcode instead. You can
then update your images across your entire site by adjusting the settings
on the plugin page.

1. Upload the `future-friendly-images` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Start inserting your **Future Friendly Images** into your posts, pages and custom post types.

### How do I insert a Future Friendly Image?

Exactly the same way as you [inserted images before][faq1]. The only
difference is that the [ffimage] shortcode will be inserted in your
post instead of the html image tag.
